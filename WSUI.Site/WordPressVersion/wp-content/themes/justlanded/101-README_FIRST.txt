=== USER MANUAL AND PLUG-INS ===
We highly recommend that you read the documentation prior 
to building your first landing page with 
JustLanded for WordPress.

The user manual, additional plug-ins and tutorials are
contained in the 'Main File' you can obtain 
from themeforest. Please remember that the installable 
theme file is NOT identical with the main file and 
contains ONLY the plain installable theme. 
You will have to download the main file separately 
in order to access additional resources that come 
with the theme.

In order to download the 'Main File', please head to
themeforest, open the 'Downloads' page and then use the
'Download' drop-down button to download the 'Main File'.
